# Introduction to Focus Blocks

## Who is it for?  
Focus Blocks is designed for self-motivated individuals who find repetitive daily routines too monotonous.  

## How to Use Focus Blocks  
1. **Plan Monthly:** At the start of the month, decide the total number of Focus Blocks and allocate them across 4-7 areas (e.g., work, exercise).  
2. **Choose Daily:** Each morning, decide which areas to work on based on remaining blocks.  
3. **Track Progress:** Check off blocks throughout the day as you complete them.  
4. **Reflect Nightly:** Review and adjust block allocations if needed to match actual progress.  

## Key Concepts  

- **Block:** A 2–2.5 hour session of focused work. Aim for 2–5 blocks per day depending on your schedule.  
- **Area:** A specific focus for the month, such as projects, hobbies, or fitness.  
- **Buffer:** Extra blocks reserved for unforeseen circumstances, ensuring flexibility.  

## Tips for Success  

1. **Integrate with Planning:**  
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Use annual or multi-year visions to guide monthly block allocations.  
   - **Daily Structure:** Wrap Focus Blocks with morning routines, breaks, and evening routines.  

2. **Work vs. Rest Days:** Classify each day as either a "Work Day" or "Play Day." Rest days should be fully restorative, while workdays are structured around Focus Blocks. 

## Benefits of Focus Blocks  

- **Sense of Achievement:** Completing a block is rewarding, as it’s based on effort rather than task completion.  
- **Flexibility with Agency:** Work on less enjoyable tasks without feeling pressured. Choose when to tackle them, knowing they must be addressed eventually.  
- **Task Decoupling:** Removes the pressure of finishing long-term tasks within one session by focusing on effort rather than visible results.  

## Background  

From 2020–2023, I used Google Sheets to track Focus Blocks but wanted something more interactive and customizable. On November 14, 2024, I released `fob`, a CLI program that brings Focus Blocks to life.
